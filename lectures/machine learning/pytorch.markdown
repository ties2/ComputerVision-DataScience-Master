PyTorch Learning Notes
This document summarizes key concepts and notes for learning PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning framework.
Machine Learning Methods

Supervised Learning: Models are trained on labeled data, where each input has a corresponding output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.
Examples: Classification, Regression


Unsupervised Learning: Models work with unlabeled data to find patterns or structures, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction.
Examples: Clustering, Autoencoders


Reinforcement Learning: An agent learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on actions, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards.
Examples: Game playing, Robotics



Key Tasks in Machine Learning

Classification: Predicting discrete labels or categories for input data.
Example: Identifying whether an email is spam or not.


Regression: Predicting continuous numerical values.
Example: Forecasting house prices based on features like size and location.



PyTorch Basics

Tensors: Core data structure in PyTorch, similar to NumPy arrays but optimized for GPU acceleration.
Example: torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])


Autograd: Automatic differentiation for computing gradients, essential for backpropagation.
Example: x.requires_grad_(True) to track computations.


Neural Networks: Built using torch.nn.Module, allowing flexible model design.
Example: Defining a simple feedforward network with nn.Linear.



Getting Started with PyTorch

Installation:pip install torch torchvision


Basic Workflow:
Load and preprocess data (e.g., using torchvision.datasets).
Define a model using torch.nn.
Specify a loss function (e.g., nn.CrossEntropyLoss for classification).
Choose an optimizer (e.g., torch.optim.SGD or torch.optim.Adam).
Train the model with a training loop, computing gradients and updating weights.
